     * Returns a filtered list of movies based on a list of selected categories
     * This method gets a list of all movies from the CategoryMovie table
     * This list will have a bunch of duiplicates of the same movie objects. 
     * The only difference in these object is there list containing one integer.
     * that integer represent a the id of a category. So if a movie object has 
     * three categories then that movie will occure three times in this list. 
     * After this the method then gets a list of selected categories and takes 
     * every categories id and inserts them into a new list. It then checks if 
     * that list only contains one id or multiple. If it has multiple category 
     * ids the method then goes into a loop where it checks every movie except 
     * the first through and compares them to a temporary movie object 
     * which is the first movie in that list. If the movies title is the same as
     * the temporary movie object then their list containing one category id 
     * will be added to the movie object. If the list gets to a movie where its 
     * title is not the same then that movie which just occured will be the new
     * temporary movie object. So we will end up with a list where there is
     * still duplicates of movies but the first occurence of a new movie will
     * have all its categories id in its list. The method then goes through every
     * movie again and checks if its list of categories id is identical to the
     * list of selected categories which was made at the start of the method. 
     * If ther are identical then they get added to the filtered list. 
     * After the loop is done then the list is then returned.
     * Also if the list of categories is not greater than one then it doesnt
     * go through this whole process. Then it just checks if the movies contains 
     * that one category. And if they do then they are added to the filtered
     * list
